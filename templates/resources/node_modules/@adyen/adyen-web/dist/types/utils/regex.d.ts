/**
 * Email regex follows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address.
 * It checks that the email address starts with a local part that includes letters, digits, and some special characters, optionally separated by periods.
 * Alternatively, the local part can be enclosed in quotes and include any characters except a new line.
 * This is followed by an `@` symbol and a domain name or an IP address enclosed in square brackets.
 * The domain name consists of one or more words separated by periods, where each word can include letters, digits, and hyphens. The top-level domain must consist of two or more letters.
